# Unreal Engine

3 Components needed: Epic Games Launcher, Unreal Engine 5, XCode.

**Epic Games Launcher and Unreal Engine 5:** \
From the local admin, snapshot the install of both Epic Games Launcher (including updates) and Unreal Engine 5. Package should be around 20GB. \
Install Unreal Engine 5 from the Epic Games Launcher. \
(Drag and drop didn't work for me) \
NOTE An Epic Games account is required for the above. It is free to sign up.

**XCode:** \
I use the App Store to install it. \
Agrements an hide the app script above. "Once per user per computer" \
If XCode is beeing used separatly to Unreal this might not work for you.

**Deployment:** \
Add the post script "unrealEpic_multiUser.sh" in the same policy as the package. \
**Set the local admin in Parameter 4.** \
This will install both the LaunchAgent _com.epic.manifests.plist_ and the script _epicManifests_cp.sh_ in the correct locations.

**What does _epicManifests_cp.sh_ do?** \
I think the Manifests files are the link between UE and Epic. They are generated during the UE installation and unique per install. \
When a new user Launches the app it will create an Epic directory in the users library with multiple components in it. \
If the Manifests files are not there, Epic wont see UE even if it is installed.
Packaging and deploying "per user per computer" the above componenets will crash Epic. \
_epicManifests_cp.sh_ will then wait until the logged in user opens Epic and generates the components to then copy the Manifests files from the local admin and place it in the logged in user Library. \
AppleScript will prompt the users to relaunch Epic as Often the apps donc sink the first time. \
If the logged in user has already used Epic the script will exit.

**LaunchAgent _com.epic.manifests.plist_**
This will trigger the script. You don't want to run the script from jamf otherwise it will hang until Epic is being opened.

NOTE The script _unrealEpic_multiUser.sh_ works if UE is already installed. \
However use _removeUsersEpic.sh_ to remove the Users epic Library. \
If the Epic folder is already there _epicManifests_cp.sh_ will exit without moving the Manifest files.

I am aware it is not ideal to have a script waiting in the background as Epic might not be laucnhed but this is the best I could find. \
It works for us but might not for other organisations hence why I make this public to have it tested.

I am open to suggestions to improve the above ðŸ™‚ This is Work In Progress...
